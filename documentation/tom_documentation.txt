# Documentation by Tom for second paper revision

## Stimuli

Details on stimulus generation are contained in Saskia's original `Documentation.pdf` file. All stimuli were generated in Python and saved as `.png`. The stimuli are stored in `/code/stimuli/`. The stimuli from experiment 1 are stored in `code/stimuli/images/distorted` (the subfolder `undistorted` are provided should that be useful for model fitting). The stimuli from Experiment 2 (labelled Experiment 3 in code) are stored as:

* Experiment 2a: 
    - `/code/stimuli/exp3img0flankersdistorted`
    - `/code/stimuli/exp3img2flankersdistorted`
    - `/code/stimuli/exp3img4flankersdistorted`
* Experiment 2b:
    - `/code/stimuli/exp3bimg4flankersdistorted`
* Experiment 2c:
    - `/code/stimuli/exp3cimg4flankersdistorted`


## Data analysis (final paper)

The analysis materials for the final version of the paper are contained in `/results/r-analysis-final-paper/`. Here Tom put together all the other data files from Saskia's historical analysis via the script `/code/analysis/data_munging_all.R`. The manuscript / analyses use the resulting `.RData` binary file, but `.csv` files are provided in addition.

Thresholds were fit via the `psignifit v4.0` toolbox. See Saskia's original "Documentation.pdf" file for those details.

The computation of spectral content (Supplementary Material) was performed in Python (see `/code/analysis/spectral_content_analysis.ipynb`).

Clutter metrics were computed in Matlab using Ruth Rosenholtz's clutter toolbox (link in the paper). See `/code/analysis/clutter_analysis.m`.

All the subsequent plotting and analysis (other than the threshold fits via `psignifit`) are performed within the manuscript (via `knitr`). See the manuscript file 

`/publications/letter_distortion_manuscript_R1.Rnw` 

for all details.
